# Course-Project

This software is created to ilustrate a prototype of a distributed stock  management system.
It was created as a school project for the python 3 exam.


Some errors:
-At the moment the delete function is not 100% working and will cause a crash.
-The client is unable to send information to the server, this might be because a Windows device was used without a "ignore-error" which 
makes the software unable to translate the bits that are to be sendt. If a manual bit sending is made when connection is established, it will work fine, so some tinkering with the Tkinder module might be needded.
